the overall process looks like - 
1) python winlibre.py install ABC
2) control goes to channel pacman, pm.py
3) pm.py searches thru the local packages.xml database
4) it then asks installer module to download the package in temp
5) the package is extracted by extract() in base class installer
6) then the install script is executed by installer, it calls MSIInstaller/NSISInstaller
6.1) as in the case of dummy install script, the call from the install script gives the URL of binary
6.2) pass the URL in smart - if its file:// its local, else on internet
6.3) the binary is downloaded by the installer module 
6.4) appropriate class MSIInstaller/NSISInstaller will handle the binary install
7) if installed correctly, append the listing to the local xml log
